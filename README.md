<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ShopsRUs

ShopsRUs is an existing retail outlet. The systems calculates discount to customers on all their web/mobile platforms. 
They require a set of APIs to be built that provide capabilities to calculate discounts, generate the total costs and generate the 
invoices for customers

### Logic Used In Generating Invoice
If the user is an affiliate of the store, user gets a 10% discount
* If the user is an employee of the store, user gets a 30% discount
* If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, user gets a 5% discount
* For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $5 discount (e.g. for $990, you get 
$45 as a discount)
* The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries
* A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill

### Built With

* ASP.NET
